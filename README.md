# What is provably fair on-chain gambling?

Simply put, provably fair means that any bet outcome can be independently verified and that the house or other players have no means of tampering with the result.

# Is fun.fair provably fair?

Yes. The whole gameplay is controlled by Ethereum Smart Contract that computes random numbers based on house inputs and blockchain data (block hashes). Anyone can check the contract, verify any transaction to make sure that neither fun.fair nor malicious players(eg. miners crafting winning bet) are influencing the results. Hence, making the platform Rig free.

# What are house fees?

Every bet is deducted 1% in favour of the house (for maintaining the platform) and 1% more gets collected in the jackpot.
