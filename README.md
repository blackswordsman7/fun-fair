>Author: Sachin Mittal

## What does your project do?
I have started on this path with a basic tic-tac-toe game.

### Use case of the project
Sachin opens a game, bets 0.01 ether and appears in a list of users who are up to play. <br>
Sanchay sees Sachin on the list and accepts the game by betting 0.01 ether too. <br>
Sachin confirms and the game starts. <br>
Sachin and Sanchay make their moves, one after each other. <br>
If one of them wins, he or she can withdraw 0.02 ether from the contract. <br>
If the game ends in a draw, both users can withdraw their respective money i.e. 0.1 ether. <br>

### Original vision of fun-fair

- Leveraging crowd wisdom to hit schelling point and find the TRUTH.

### Motivation

- According to the stats of DApp reviewing websites, and consensys blogs. The blockchain mainstream adoption and increase in  DAU (Daily active users) can be enhanced by Games, and casinos. 



### Aim

Create a gaming SDK, where gamers can clash with each other, and eventually put some skin in the game to make it more competitive.
